# cdviz

keywords: `cdevents`, `sdlc`
status: wip

A set of components to provide a view of which version of services are deployed and which environment, what test ran,...

- Collect every events ([cdevents]) related to the deployment of artifacts (service, ...), tasks, tests,...
- Dashboard to query and visualize events and states over time

## Architecture Overview

![cdviz architecture](doc/images/Drawing%202023-12-27%2016.04.47-cdviz-architecture.excalidraw.svg)

### Q&A

<details>
<summary>Why do dashboard tools, like Grafana, have access (read-only) to the DB (PostgreSQL), and go through an API (micro)service (like `cdviz-collector`)?</summary>

- access to the data is the value, not the service
- allow dashboards to use the full query power of SQL to query data, and to plug any analytics tools
- allow Data Ops to split the DB with read-only replicas if needed,...
- no need to create and provide a new custom (and always incomplete, frustrated) query language
  - no need to maintain a custom query language on the service side
  - no need to maintain a connector (`datasource`) for callers (analytics tools,...)
  - no need to re-invent (or to "encapsulate") what DB managers do better
- enforce the read-only view of the DB to be like a public API
  - require to configure access control
  - require to document and expose table structure (like an API) and to provide samples of queries, maybe function,...
- service can provide helper endpoints for some complex queries or additional "views"
