## Ideas & Maybe

- a simple ruler to trigger for events likes:
  - on deploy of version X of service, send a remove of previous version (same service, package, environment)
- collect SBOM, and connect it to the events to enhance info, lifecycle of components of deployed artifacts
- deduce SBOM (via rules, ...)
