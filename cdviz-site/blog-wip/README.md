### Published Content Location

When blog posts are ready for publication, they move to:

```txt
cdviz-site/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/blog/                   # Published blog posts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.md                   # Final blog post content
â””â”€â”€ assets/blog/               # Published blog assets
    â”œâ”€â”€ *.svg                  # Generated diagrams
    â”œâ”€â”€ *.png                  # Screenshots and images
    â””â”€â”€ *.excalidraw.svg      # Excalidraw exports
```

## Purpose

This working area serves as a place to:

- **Draft** blog post content and ideas
- **Plan** blog series and content strategy
- **Store** planning documents and roadmaps
- **Collect** assets and resources for future posts

## Publishing Workflow

### 1. Draft Creation

Write drafts in `src/` directory or as planning documents in the root.

### 2. Content Review

Review tone, structure, and technical accuracy before publication.

### 3. Asset Preparation

Create any needed diagrams or images:

- Use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) for diagrams
- Apply CDviz styling: orange (#f08c00), hand-drawn style
- Export as SVG for web use

### 4. Publication Steps

1. **External publication** (e.g., dev.to) for wider reach
2. **Move to main site**: Copy content to `cdviz-site/src/blog/`
3. **Move assets**: Copy images/diagrams to `cdviz-site/assets/blog/`
4. **Update references**: Ensure all asset paths work in main site

### 5. Cross-Platform Publishing

- **dev.to**: Use for community engagement and SEO
- **CDviz website**: Include in main site for documentation value
- **Social media**: Extract key points for LinkedIn, Twitter
