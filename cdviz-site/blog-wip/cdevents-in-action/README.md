# CDEvents in Action Series

This directory contains episodes for the "CDEvents in Action" educational series focused on practical CDEvents implementation patterns.

## Series Overview

**Goal**: Introduce CDEvents standard and practical implementation with CDviz to the dev.to community
**Target Audience**: DevOps engineers, platform engineers, developers implementing SDLC observability
**Publishing**: Weekly episodes on dev.to with optimal learning progression
**Strategy**: Educational content in blog, detailed implementation in CDviz documentation

## Content Strategy

### **Blog Series Role:**
- **Educational**: Concepts, use cases, decision frameworks
- **Pattern-focused**: Reusable approaches, not tool-specific details
- **Reference-driven**: Points to CDviz documentation for implementation
- **SEO optimized**: "CDEvents in Action #N: Title" format

### **CDviz Documentation Role:**
- **Implementation guides**: Step-by-step integration tutorials
- **Configuration examples**: Real YAML, JSON, code samples
- **Technical references**: API specifications, troubleshooting
