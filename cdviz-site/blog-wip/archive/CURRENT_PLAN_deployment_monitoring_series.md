## Content Strategy

### Format Approach

- **Practical Examples**: Every article includes working code/commands
- **Decision Frameworks**: Clear guidance on when to use each pattern
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Honest assessment of pros/cons for each approach
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each article builds on previous knowledge

### Documentation Integration

- **Minimal Duplication**: Link to official docs for installation/config
- **Focus on Implementation**: Blog focuses on practical integration patterns
- **Reference Official Docs**: Point to comprehensive technical documentation
- **Community Building**: Encourage sharing of implementation experiences

### Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: Track implementation of different patterns
- **Community Feedback**: Monitor comments and questions
- **Documentation Quality**: Measure reduction in support requests
- **Feature Requests**: Capture input for product development

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

- Refine Series 1 (existing content)
- Complete Series 2 (direct pipeline integration)

### Phase 2: Passive Monitoring

- Develop Series 3 (Kubernetes monitoring)
- Create practical examples and testing

### Phase 3: GitOps Integration

- Complete Series 4 (ArgoCD and registries)
- Validate with real-world implementations

### Phase 4: Advanced Patterns

- Develop Series 5 (custom sources and scaling)
- Document production best practices

## Success Criteria

- Each article provides working, tested examples
- Clear decision framework for choosing integration patterns
- Reduced duplication with official documentation
- Strong community engagement and feedback
- Observable increase in CDviz adoption across different integration patterns
