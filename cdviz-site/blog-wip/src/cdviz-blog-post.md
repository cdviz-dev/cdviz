# Stop Flying Blind: Why You Need Pipeline Visibility Yesterday

*Your software delivery metrics are scattered across a dozen tools. Here's how to finally connect the dots.*

## The Multi-Tool Nightmare

You've invested in the best CI/CD tools money can buy. Jenkins for builds. GitHub Actions for automation. Kubernetes for orchestration. Datadog for monitoring. PagerDuty for incidents.

Yet when your CEO asks a simple question like "How fast do we actually ship features?" or "What's our deployment success rate?", you find yourself playing detective across 12 different browser tabs, manually correlating timestamps and praying the data makes sense.

This isn't a tooling problem—it's a **visibility problem**. Your pipeline events are trapped in silos, creating blind spots that make it impossible to answer fundamental questions about your engineering effectiveness.

## Enter CDviz: Monitor Your Software Delivery Pipeline With Confidence

CDviz solves this with a simple but powerful approach: **unified visibility** across your entire software delivery lifecycle. No more tool-hopping. No more manual correlation. Just real-time insights into what's actually happening in your pipeline.

Built on the [CDEvents specification](https://cdevents.dev/)—the emerging Cloud Native standard for delivery events—CDviz breaks down the silos between your CI/CD tools and gives you a single source of truth for delivery events.

### The Zero-Friction Difference

**Seamless Integration**: CDviz connects with your existing tools (GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, Kubernetes) without disrupting your current workflows. Deploy the collector, point it at your tools, and start getting insights immediately.

**Standardized Events**: Every deployment, test run, and incident becomes a standardized CDEvent. This means consistent data structure across all your tools, making correlation and analysis actually possible.

**Your Data, Your Control**: Unlike SaaS monitoring tools, CDviz stores everything in PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB. Your data stays in your infrastructure, and you can query it with the full power of SQL or integrate with any analytics tool.

## Real Problems, Real Solutions

Here's what CDviz helps you answer that your current stack probably can't:

- **"Which version of service X is running in production right now?"** → Real-time deployment tracking across all environments
- **"How long does our typical deployment take from commit to production?"** → End-to-end pipeline duration metrics
- **"What's our DORA metrics baseline before we implement that new deployment strategy?"** → Built-in DORA metrics dashboards
- **"Did that incident correlate with any recent deployments?"** → Event correlation across deployments, tests, and incidents

## Getting Started: 5 Minutes to "Aha!"

The fastest way to understand CDviz is to see it in action:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdviz-dev/cdviz.git
cd cdviz/demos/stack-compose
docker compose up
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and start sending events through the demo interface. Within minutes, you'll see deployment frequency metrics, incident correlation, and timeline views that give you insights into your software delivery process.

## Architecture That Makes Sense

CDviz follows a simple but powerful pattern:

```
Event Sources → CDviz Collector → PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB → Grafana Dashboards
```

**CDviz Collector**: Rust-based event collection service that gathers events from CI, CD, testing, and incident management tools. It transforms and forwards events to your database and other systems.

**CDviz Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extensions, optimized for time-series event data. Schema migrations handled by Atlas.

**CDviz Grafana**: Custom dashboards with D3.js panels for complex visualizations, generated from TypeScript using the Grafana Foundation SDK.

## The Open Source Advantage

CDviz is built with a strong commitment to open source principles:

- **Core collector**: AGPL v3 licensed
- **Database and Grafana components**: Apache License v2
- **Kubernetes-native**: Deploy anywhere with Helm charts
- **Standard-based**: Built on CDEvents specification for interoperability

This isn't vendor lock-in disguised as open source. Your data lives in PostgreSQL. Your visualizations are in Grafana. You can migrate away at any time, but you won't want to.

## Who Should Care About This

**Platform Engineers**: Finally, a way to provide centralized delivery metrics without building yet another internal tool.

**Engineering Managers**: Get visibility into deployment velocity, failure rates, and recovery times without spreadsheet archaeology.

**DevOps Teams**: Correlate deployments with incidents, track MTTR across services, and identify bottlenecks in your delivery pipeline.

**CTOs**: Demonstrate engineering efficiency improvements with data, not anecdotes.

## The CDEvents Connection

CDviz isn't just another monitoring tool—it's part of a larger movement toward standardizing delivery event data. The CDEvents specification is gaining traction across the cloud native ecosystem, and CDviz team members actively contribute to the specification.

This means as more tools adopt CDEvents, your CDviz installation becomes more valuable. Instead of building custom integrations for every tool, you get standardized event ingestion across your entire stack.

## What's Next

Ready to stop playing deployment detective? Here's how to get started:

1. **Try the demo**: 5-minute Docker Compose setup at [cdviz.dev](https://cdviz.dev)
2. **Join the community**: GitHub discussions, issue tracking, and roadmap planning
3. **Deploy in production**: Kubernetes Helm charts with production-ready configurations

The future of software delivery observability isn't about more dashboards—it's about better connected data. CDviz gives you that connection.
