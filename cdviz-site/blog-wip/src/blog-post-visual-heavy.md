# Stop Flying Blind: Why You Need Pipeline Visibility Yesterday

_Your software delivery metrics are scattered across a dozen tools. Here's how to finally connect the dots._

![Pipeline Visibility Problem](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/2d3748/ffffff?text=Before%3A+Scattered+Tools+%26+Blind+Spots)
_The current state: Your pipeline data is trapped in silos_

## The Multi-Tool Nightmare

You've invested in the best CI/CD tools money can buy. Jenkins for builds. GitHub Actions for automation. Kubernetes for orchestration. Datadog for monitoring. PagerDuty for incidents.

Yet when your CEO asks a simple question like "How fast do we actually ship features?" or "What's our deployment success rate?", you find yourself playing detective across 12 different browser tabs, manually correlating timestamps and praying the data makes sense.

### The Visualization of the Problem

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[GitHub Actions] --> Z[???]
    B[Jenkins] --> Z
    C[ArgoCD] --> Z
    D[Datadog] --> Z
    E[PagerDuty] --> Z
    F[Kubernetes] --> Z

    Z --> Q1["❓ Deployment Success Rate?"]
    Z --> Q2["❓ MTTR Across Services?"]
    Z --> Q3["❓ Release Velocity?"]

    style Z fill:#ff6b6b
    style Q1 fill:#ffd93d
    style Q2 fill:#ffd93d
    style Q3 fill:#ffd93d
```

This isn't a tooling problem—it's a **visibility problem**. Your pipeline events are trapped in silos, creating blind spots that make it impossible to answer fundamental questions about your engineering effectiveness.

## Enter CDviz: Monitor Your Software Delivery Pipeline With Confidence

CDviz solves this with a simple but powerful approach: **unified visibility** across your entire software delivery lifecycle. No more tool-hopping. No more manual correlation. Just real-time insights into what's actually happening in your pipeline.

### The Architecture That Makes It Work

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Sources["Event Sources"]
        A[GitHub Actions]
        B[Jenkins]
        C[ArgoCD]
        D[Kubernetes]
        E[PagerDuty]
    end

    subgraph CDviz["CDviz Platform"]
        F[CDviz Collector]
        G[(PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB)]
        H[Grafana Dashboards]
    end

    A --> F
    B --> F
    C --> F
    D --> F
    E --> F

    F --> G
    G --> H

    H --> I[📊 DORA Metrics]
    H --> J[📈 Deployment Frequency]
    H --> K[⏱️ Lead Time]
    H --> L[🔍 Incident Correlation]

    style G fill:#50e3c2
    style H fill:#7ed321
```

Built on the [CDEvents specification](https://cdevents.dev/)—the emerging Cloud Native standard for delivery events—CDviz breaks down the silos between your CI/CD tools and gives you a single source of truth for delivery events.

### Before: Scattered Metrics Across Multiple Tools

![Scattered Tools](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300/ff6b6b/ffffff?text=Jenkins+Build+Dashboard)
_Jenkins: Build status and duration_

![Separate Monitoring](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300/ff6b6b/ffffff?text=Datadog+Infrastructure+Monitoring)
_Datadog: Infrastructure monitoring_

![Incident Management](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300/ff6b6b/ffffff?text=PagerDuty+Incident+Dashboard)
_PagerDuty: Incident management_

### After: Unified CDviz Dashboards

![CDviz Deployment Dashboard](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/7ed321/ffffff?text=CDviz+Unified+Deployment+Dashboard)
_CDviz: All your deployment metrics in one unified view_

Key metrics visible at a glance:

- ✅ Deployment frequency across all services
- ⏱️ Lead time from commit to production
- 🎯 Success/failure rates by environment
- 🔍 Incident correlation with deployments

## The Zero-Friction Difference

**Seamless Integration**: CDviz connects with your existing tools (GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, Kubernetes) without disrupting your current workflows. Deploy the collector, point it at your tools, and start getting insights immediately.

![Integration Flow](https://via.placeholder.com/700x200/4a90e2/ffffff?text=Easy+Integration+Flow)

**Standardized Events**: Every deployment, test run, and incident becomes a standardized CDEvent. This means consistent data structure across all your tools, making correlation and analysis actually possible.

### Visual Event Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant GH as GitHub Actions
    participant Col as CDviz Collector
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Graf as Grafana

    Dev->>GH: Push code
    GH->>Col: Deployment Event
    Col->>DB: Store CDEvent
    Graf->>DB: Query events
    Graf->>Dev: Real-time dashboard update
```

## Real Problems, Real Dashboard Solutions

Here's what CDviz helps you visualize that your current stack probably can't:

### 1. Deployment Timeline Visualization

![Timeline View](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300/50e3c2/ffffff?text=Service+Deployment+Timeline)
_See exactly when each service was deployed across all environments_

### 2. DORA Metrics Dashboard

![DORA Metrics](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/7ed321/ffffff?text=DORA+Metrics+Dashboard)
_Track deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate_

### 3. Incident Correlation View

![Incident Correlation](https://via.placeholder.com/800x350/ffd93d/ffffff?text=Incident+vs+Deployment+Correlation)
_Instantly see which deployments correlate with incidents_

## The Open Source Advantage

CDviz architecture diagram:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Open Source Components"
        A[CDviz Collector<br/>Apache v2]
        B[CDviz Database<br/>Apache v2]
        C[CDviz Grafana<br/>Apache v2]
    end

    subgraph "Your Infrastructure"
        D[PostgreSQL]
        E[Grafana]
        F[Kubernetes]
    end

    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> E

    style A fill:#7ed321
    style B fill:#7ed321
    style C fill:#7ed321
```

This isn't vendor lock-in disguised as open source. Your data lives in PostgreSQL. Your visualizations are in Grafana. You can migrate away at any time, but you won't want to.
