# Pipeline Visibility Crisis: When Your Tools Don't Talk

Your CI/CD stack is impressive: GitHub, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Datadog, PagerDuty. But when leadership asks "How fast do we deploy?" you're opening 6 browser tabs and building spreadsheets.

## The Current Reality

![Scattered Tools Problem](blog-scattered-vs-unified.excalidraw.svg)
*Before CDviz: You manually correlate data from scattered tools*

Each tool has data. None talk to each other. You become the integration layer.

## What CDviz Actually Provides Today

**Event Collection**: Standardized [CDEvents](https://cdevents.dev/) from your existing tools
**Storage**: PostgreSQL database with TimescaleDB for time-series data
**Visualization**: Pre-built Grafana dashboards for deployment tracking

### Current Dashboards

- Service deployment timeline
- CDEvents activity feed
- Artifact tracking across environments

### What's Not Included (Yet)

- DORA metrics calculations (you build the SQL)
- Automated incident correlation (data is there, queries are yours)
- Multi-team comparisons (possible but requires setup)

## 5-Minute Demo: See the Difference

```bash
# Start CDviz locally
git clone https://github.com/cdviz-dev/cdviz.git
cd cdviz/demos/stack-compose
docker compose up

# Send a deployment event
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "context": {
      "version": "0.4.0",
      "id": "demo-deploy-1",
      "source": "demo",
      "type": "dev.cdevents.service.deployed.0.1.1",
      "timestamp": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"
    },
    "subject": {
      "id": "my-service",
      "type": "service",
      "content": {
        "environment": {"id": "production"},
        "artifactId": "pkg:oci/my-service@v1.2.3"
      }
    }
  }'

# View dashboard
open http://localhost:3000/d/demo-service-deployed/demo-service-deployed
```

**Result**: Event appears immediately in timeline. No manual correlation needed.

## The Value: Time and Accuracy

**Before CDviz**:

- Query GitHub: 5 minutes
- Check Jenkins: 3 minutes
- Correlate timestamps: 10 minutes
- Build report: 15 minutes
- **Total**: 33 minutes per request

**With CDviz integration**:

- Open dashboard: 1 minute
- **Total**: 1 minute

## Real Questions CDviz Helps Answer

‚úÖ "What version is running in production right now?"
‚úÖ "When did we last deploy service X?"
‚úÖ "Show me all deployments from last week"
‚úÖ "What's our deployment frequency?"

üîÑ "How do teams compare?" (data available, dashboard TBD)
‚ùå "What's our lead time?" (needs commit events integration)

## Next Steps

**Article 2**: Hands-on tutorial connecting your GitHub Actions to CDviz
**Article 3**: Production deployment patterns with Kubernetes

The goal isn't perfect metrics overnight‚Äîit's unified event collection that scales with your team.
