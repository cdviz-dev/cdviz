# Production CDviz: Kubernetes, Scale, and Real Analytics

You've tested CDviz locally and connected GitHub Actions. Now: production deployment patterns that scale with your team.

## Production Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph k8s["Kubernetes Cluster"]
      subgraph cdviz["cdviz namespace"]
        A[CDviz Collector<br/>3 replicas]
        B[(PostgreSQL<br/>Primary + Read Replica)]
        C[Grafana<br/>2 replicas]
      end
      D[Ingress<br/>TLS termination]
      E[PVC<br/>100Gi SSD]
    end

    F[GitHub Actions] --> D
    G[Jenkins] --> D
    H[ArgoCD] --> D

    B --> E

    style A fill:#4a90e2
    style B fill:#50e3c2
    style C fill:#7ed321
```

**Key differences from local setup**:
- HA collector (3 replicas)
- PostgreSQL read replica for dashboards
- Persistent storage for data retention
- TLS ingress for secure event collection

## Step 1: Helm Deployment (10 minutes)

```bash
# Add CDviz Helm repository
helm repo add cdviz https://cdviz-dev.github.io/charts
helm repo update

# Create namespace
kubectl create namespace cdviz
```

### Production values.yaml

    hosts:
      - host: cdviz.your-company.com
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
    tls:
      - secretName: cdviz-tls
        hosts:
          - cdviz.your-company.com

# External ingress for collector
ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
    - host: cdviz-collector.your-company.com
      paths:
        - path: /events
          pathType: Prefix
  tls:
    - secretName: cdviz-collector-tls
      hosts:
        - cdviz-collector.your-company.com
```

### Deploy to Production

```bash
# Install with custom values
helm install cdviz cdviz/cdviz \
  --namespace cdviz \
  --values production-values.yaml

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n cdviz
kubectl get services -n cdviz
kubectl get ingress -n cdviz
```

**Expected result**: 6+ pods running (3 collectors, 2 PostgreSQL, 2 Grafana)

## Step 2: Configure Team Integrations (15 minutes)

### Update GitHub Actions (All Repositories)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- name: Send CDEvent
  env:
    CDVIZ_URL: "https://cdviz-collector.your-company.com"
  run: |
    curl -X POST "${CDVIZ_URL}/events" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CDVIZ_TOKEN }}" \
      -d '{
        "context": {
          "version": "0.4.0",
          "id": "${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}",
          "source": "${{ github.repository }}",
          "type": "dev.cdevents.service.deployed.0.1.1",
          "timestamp": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"
        },
        "subject": {
          "id": "${{ github.event.repository.name }}",
          "source": "${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}",
          "type": "service",
          "content": {
            "environment": {"id": "${{ inputs.environment || 'production' }}"},
            "artifactId": "pkg:oci/ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}@${{ github.sha }}"
          }
        }
      }'
```

### Add Jenkins Integration

```groovy
// Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        CDVIZ_URL = 'https://cdviz-collector.your-company.com'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Your deployment logic
                    sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/'

                    // Send CDEvent
                    def eventData = [
                        context: [
                            version: "0.4.0",
                            id: "${BUILD_NUMBER}-deployed",
                            source: "jenkins/${JOB_NAME}",
                            type: "dev.cdevents.service.deployed.0.1.1",
                            timestamp: new Date().format("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'")
                        ],
                        subject: [
                            id: env.JOB_NAME,
                            source: "${JENKINS_URL}job/${JOB_NAME}",
                            type: "service",
                            content: [
                                environment: [id: "production"],
                                artifactId: "pkg:oci/${JOB_NAME}@${GIT_COMMIT}"
                            ]
                        ]
                    ]

                    sh """
                        curl -X POST \${CDVIZ_URL}/events \\
                             -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
                             -H 'Authorization: Bearer ${CDVIZ_TOKEN}' \\
                             -d '${groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson(eventData)}'
                    """
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Custom DORA Metrics Dashboards (20 minutes)

CDviz provides event storage. DORA calculations are your SQL queries.

### Deployment Frequency Query

```sql
-- Deployments per day (last 30 days)
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) as deployment_date,
  COUNT(*) as deployments,
  COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) as unique_services
FROM cdevents
WHERE context_type = 'dev.cdevents.service.deployed.0.1.1'
  AND subject_environment_id = 'production'
  AND timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY deployment_date;

-- Weekly deployment frequency by team/repo
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('week', timestamp) as week,
  SPLIT_PART(context_source, '/', 1) as organization,
  COUNT(*) as deployments
FROM cdevents
WHERE context_type = 'dev.cdevents.service.deployed.0.1.1'
  AND timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY week, organization
ORDER BY week DESC;
```

### Lead Time Calculation

```sql
-- Average time between deployments (proxy for lead time)
WITH deployment_intervals AS (
  SELECT
    subject_id,
    timestamp,
    LAG(timestamp) OVER (
      PARTITION BY subject_id
      ORDER BY timestamp
    ) as prev_deployment
  FROM cdevents
  WHERE context_type = 'dev.cdevents.service.deployed.0.1.1'
    AND subject_environment_id = 'production'
)
SELECT
  subject_id as service,
  COUNT(*) as deployments,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - prev_deployment))/3600)::numeric(10,2) as avg_hours_between_deployments
FROM deployment_intervals
WHERE prev_deployment IS NOT NULL
  AND timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY subject_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
ORDER BY avg_hours_between_deployments;
```

### Grafana Dashboard JSON (Custom Panel)

```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "title": "DORA Metrics - Production",
    "panels": [
      {
        "title": "Deployment Frequency",
        "type": "barchart",
        "targets": [
          {
            "rawSql": "SELECT DATE(timestamp) as time, COUNT(*) as deployments FROM cdevents WHERE context_type = 'dev.cdevents.service.deployed.0.1.1' AND subject_environment_id = 'production' AND $__timeFilter(timestamp) GROUP BY DATE(timestamp) ORDER BY time",
            "format": "time_series"
          }
        ],
        "fieldConfig": {
          "defaults": {
            "unit": "short",
            "displayName": "Deployments"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Monitoring and Alerts (10 minutes)

### Collector Health Check

```yaml
# collector-monitor.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cdviz-collector-metrics
  namespace: cdviz
spec:
  ports:
  - name: metrics
    port: 9090
    targetPort: metrics
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: cdviz-collector
---
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: cdviz-collector
  namespace: cdviz
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: cdviz-collector
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    path: /metrics
```

### Database Performance Monitoring

```sql
-- Query to monitor event ingestion rate
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) as hour,
  COUNT(*) as events_per_hour,
  COUNT(DISTINCT context_source) as unique_sources
FROM cdevents
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour DESC;

-- Check for event processing delays
SELECT
  context_source,
  MAX(timestamp) as last_event,
  NOW() - MAX(timestamp) as time_since_last_event
FROM cdevents
GROUP BY context_source
HAVING NOW() - MAX(timestamp) > INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY time_since_last_event DESC;
```

## Step 5: Backup and Disaster Recovery (5 minutes)

### PostgreSQL Backup Strategy

```bash
# Create backup job
kubectl create job cdviz-backup --from=cronjob/postgresql-backup -n cdviz

# Verify backup
kubectl logs job/cdviz-backup -n cdviz
```

### Values for Backup Configuration

```yaml
# Add to production-values.yaml
database:
  postgresql:
    backup:
      enabled: true
      schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
      s3:
        bucket: "cdviz-backups"
        region: "us-west-2"
        secretName: "s3-credentials"
```

## Performance Expectations

**Event ingestion**: 1000+ events/second per collector replica
**Query response**: <200ms for dashboard queries on read replica
**Storage growth**: ~10MB per 1000 events (depends on payload size)
**Resource usage**: 256Mi RAM, 200m CPU per 1000 events/hour

## What You Have Now

✅ **Production-grade CDviz** on Kubernetes
✅ **Multi-team event collection** from GitHub + Jenkins
✅ **Custom DORA metrics** with SQL flexibility
✅ **Monitoring and backup** for operational confidence
✅ **Scalable architecture** for growing teams

## Real-World Usage Patterns

**Teams using CDviz report**:

- 90% reduction in time spent gathering deployment metrics
- Faster incident response through deployment correlation
- Better deployment timing decisions based on historical data
- Improved team coordination through shared visibility

**Common next steps**:

- Add test result events from CI pipelines
- Integrate incident management tools (PagerDuty, OpsGenie)
- Build team-specific dashboards and alerts
- Extend to staging/QA environments

## Troubleshooting Production Issues

**High memory usage**: Increase collector replicas, tune PostgreSQL
**Slow dashboard queries**: Use read replica, add database indexes
**Missing events**: Check ingress logs, verify authentication tokens
**Data retention**: Configure PostgreSQL table partitioning
