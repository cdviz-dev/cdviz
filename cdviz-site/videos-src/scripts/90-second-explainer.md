## Script with Timing

### Opening Hook (0-15 seconds)

**Visual**: Split screen - scattered deployment info vs unified CDviz timeline
**Voiceover** (40 words, ~12 seconds):
_"Your team deploys constantly across dev, staging, and production. But do you actually know what version is running where? And when performance drops, can you correlate it with recent deployments?"_

**On-screen text**: "Know What's Deployed When"

**Blender Notes**:

- Use existing tool icons from `assets-src/icons_48x48_monochrome/`
- Animate icons floating chaotically, then organizing into clean flow
- Text fade-in with subtle animation

---

### Problem Deep Dive (15-30 seconds)

**Visual**: Animation showing scattered deployment information across tools
**Voiceover** (46 words, ~14 seconds):
_"The challenge? Deployment history is scattered across Jenkins builds, GitLab releases, Kubernetes events, and monitoring dashboards. You can't see the complete timeline or easily correlate runtime issues with specific deployments. Your SDLC visibility is fragmented."_

**On-screen text**: "Scattered History = Lost Context"

**Blender Notes**:

- Grease Pencil to draw connection lines with question marks
- Use "Build" modifier for line drawing effect
- Color scheme: problems in red/orange, solutions in blue/green

---

### Solution Introduction (30-50 seconds)

**Visual**: CDEvents logo animation, unified event timeline forming
**Voiceover** (50 words, ~17 seconds):
_"Enter CDEvents - the Cloud Native standard for delivery events. CDviz collects these standardized events from all your tools and creates a unified deployment timeline. Now you have complete visibility into what's deployed where, when, and by whom."_

**On-screen text**: "Unified SDLC Timeline"

**Blender Notes**:

- Import CDEvents logo from `assets/logos/cdevents.svg`
- Animate standardized event packets flowing between tools
- Use particle system for event flow visualization

---

### Product Demo (50-75 seconds)

**Visual**: Real CDviz dashboard screenshots with callouts
**Voiceover** (54 words, ~18 seconds):
_"See every service deployment across environments in one timeline. Correlate performance metrics with specific versions. Track your DORA metrics automatically. And when tests pass, trigger the next deployment. CDviz gives you the visibility to optimize your entire software delivery pipeline."_

**On-screen highlights**:

- Deployment timeline showing version progression across environments
- Metrics correlation view (performance drop → specific deployment)
- DORA metrics dashboard (deployment frequency, lead time trends)
- Event-driven automation workflow (test pass → deployment trigger)

**Blender Notes**:

- Import dashboard screenshots from `assets/screenshots/`
- Use Grease Pencil for highlight circles and arrows
- Animate data appearing in charts with "Build" modifier

---

### Call to Action (75-90 seconds)

**Visual**: CDviz.dev website, pricing tiers
**Voiceover** (36 words, ~13 seconds):
_"CDviz is open source - start with the free community edition, upgrade when you need enterprise features. Get complete SDLC visibility today. Visit cdviz.dev and take control of your deployments."_

**On-screen text**:

- "cdviz.dev" (large, prominent)
- "Complete SDLC Visibility"
- "Start Free Today"

**Blender Notes**:

- Clean transition to website mockup
- Text animations with slight scale/fade effects
- End with subtle call-to-action button highlight

- Dashboard screenshots: `cdviz-site/assets/screenshots/grafana_*.png`
- Tool icons: `cdviz-site/assets-src/icons_48x48_monochrome/`
- CDviz logo: `cdviz-site/assets/logos/cdviz.svg`
- CDEvents logo: `cdviz-site/assets/logos/cdevents.svg`

### To Create

- Animated event flow diagrams
- Tool connection visualizations
- Dashboard highlight overlays
- Text animations and transitions

## Variations to Produce

1. **90-second Full Version** - Primary marketing asset
2. **60-second Cut** - Social media friendly (remove problem section)
3. **30-second Teaser** - Demo + CTA only for ads
4. **15-second Micro** - Problem statement + website URL for retargeting

## Script Refinements Made

### Key Improvements

1. **Focused Value Prop**: Deployment visibility and version correlation vs debugging
2. **Real Use Cases**: Timeline tracking, metrics correlation, automated workflows
3. **Accurate Problem**: Scattered deployment history vs emergency scenarios
4. **Core Benefits**: SDLC optimization, complete visibility, event-driven automation
5. **Clear CTA**: "Take control of your deployments" aligns with actual value

### Value Proposition Alignment

- **Deployment Visibility**: Know what's deployed where and when
- **Version Correlation**: Connect runtime metrics to specific deployments
- **SDLC Insights**: Complete pipeline visibility and DORA metrics
- **Event-Driven**: Automation based on deployment events (test pass → promote)
- **Timeline View**: Unified view across all environments and tools

### Technical Accuracy

- Correctly positions CDviz as SDLC observability platform
- Emphasizes deployment history and version tracking
- Shows metrics correlation capabilities
- Highlights event-driven automation potential
- Maintains open-source positioning
