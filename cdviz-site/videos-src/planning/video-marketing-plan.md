### One-Time Costs

- **Music Licensing**: Epidemic Sound or similar ($15-30/month)

### Ongoing Costs

- **Video Hosting**: YouTube (free) + website CDN ($10-20/month)
- **Tools**: Thumbnail creation, analytics tracking ($20-40/month)
- **Time Investment**: 8-12 hours per video (including learning curve)

### ROI Calculation

- **Video Cost**: ~$50/month tools + 10 hours time
- **Value**: If video increases conversions by 25%, ROI is 5-10x
- **Comparison**: Much cheaper than hiring marketing agency ($3-5K/month)

## Risk Mitigation

### Quality Concerns

- **Solution**: Start with "good enough" and iterate based on feedback
- **Fallback**: Simple screen recordings are better than no videos
- **Improvement**: Gradually increase production value as skills develop

### Time Management

- **Efficiency**: Reuse Blender assets across multiple videos
- **Focus**: Prioritize videos that directly drive trial signups

### Technical Challenges

- **Learning Curve**: Invest 2-3 days upfront learning Blender basics
- **Templates**: Create reusable Blender templates for consistent style
- **Community**: Use Blender forums/communities for specific technical help
