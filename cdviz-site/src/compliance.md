# Licensing

CDviz is dual licensed under GNU AGPL v3 and commercial license, except for the components explicitly under the Apache Software License v2.

The GNU AGPL v3 is designed for developers who are building open source applications in compliance with the GNU AGPL v3 license and are able to support themselves. It is fully featured. If you distribute, host or create derivative works of the CDviz software over the network, the GNU AGPL v3 license requires that you also distribute the complete, corresponding source code of the combined work under the same GNU AGPL v3 license. This requirement applies whether or not you modified CDviz. Please consult the license [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) or review the FAQs below.

A commercial license is available.

## Licensing FAQs

### What is the GNU AGPL v3?

The GNU AGPL v3 is short for the "GNU Affero General Public License v3." It is a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) license certified by the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) and the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/). You can get a copy of the GNU AGPL v3 license with CDviz source code or at <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html>.

### What does it mean for me to comply with the GNU AGPL v3?

When you host or distribute CDviz over a network, the AGPL v3 applies to you. Any distribution or copying of CDviz software modified or not has to comply with the obligations specified in the AGPL v3 license. You must include the source code, full license text and the original copyright notice along with the object code.

We recommend the [Free Software Foundationâ€™s interpretation](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) of the GNU AGPL v3 license.

### Making combined or derivative works of CDviz

Creating combined or derivative works of CDviz requires all such works to be released under the same license.

If CDviz source code is included in the same executable file, they are definitely combined in one program. If modules are designed to run linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means combining them into one program.

By contrast, pipes, sockets, RESTful APIs, and command-line arguments are communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs. So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are separate programs. But if the semantics of the communication are intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger program.

Merely aggregating CDviz software into your distribution does not constitute derivative works. For more information, please refer to the [GPL FAQ.](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#MereAggregation).

### Talking to your Legal Counsel

If you have questions, we recommend that you talk to your own attorney for legal advice. Purchasing a commercial license from CDviz removes the GNU AGPL v3 obligations from CDviz software.
