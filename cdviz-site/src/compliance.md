# Licensing

CDviz components are licensed under the Apache Software License v2 (Apache-2.0), providing you with the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software.

## License Changes

**Important:** The cdviz-collector has migrated from AGPL v3 to Apache License v2 starting with version v0.15. This eliminates the need for licensing compliance concerns while using the open source version.

- **cdviz-collector v0.15+**: Apache License v2
- **cdviz-collector v0.14 and earlier**: AGPL v3 (legacy versions)
- **cdviz-db**: Apache License v2
- **cdviz-grafana**: Apache License v2

## Apache License v2

The Apache License v2 is a permissive open source license that allows you to:

- Use the software for any purpose, including commercial use
- Distribute it
- Modify it
- Distribute modified versions
- Use it in proprietary software without open sourcing your changes

The main requirements are:

- Include the license and copyright notice
- State changes made to the original work
- Include the NOTICE file if one exists

For the full license text, see [Apache License v2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Commercial Subscriptions

While the open source components are freely available under Apache License v2, CDviz offers commercial subscriptions that provide:

- **Enterprise features**: Additional functionality not available in the open source version
- **Professional support**: Direct access to our engineering team
- **Service level agreements**: Guaranteed response times and support commitments
- **Consultation services**: Help with implementation, optimization, and best practices
- **Development support**: Your subscription helps fund the ongoing maintenance and development of CDviz, including the open source components

These subscriptions are service offerings, not licensing requirements. By subscribing, you're not only getting additional features and support, but also contributing to the sustainable development of the entire CDviz ecosystem.

## Licensing FAQs

### Why did CDviz change from AGPL v3 to Apache License v2?

We changed the license to Apache License v2 starting with cdviz-collector v0.15 to:

- **Increase adoption**: Apache License v2 is more business-friendly and widely accepted
- **Simplify compliance**: Permissive license reduces legal complexity
- **Enable enterprise use**: Easier integration into commercial products and services
- **Align with ecosystem**: Many CNCF and open source projects use Apache License v2

### What does Apache License v2 mean for users?

The Apache License v2 is a permissive license that gives you significant freedom:

- **Commercial use**: You can use CDviz in commercial products without restrictions
- **Modification**: You can modify the source code for your needs
- **Distribution**: You can distribute original or modified versions
- **Private use**: You can use and modify CDviz privately without sharing changes
- **Patent protection**: The license provides an express grant of patent rights

### Do I need to open source my modifications?

No. Unlike copyleft licenses (such as AGPL v3), Apache License v2 does not require you to open source your modifications or derivative works. You only need to:

- Include the original license and copyright notices
- Document changes you made to the original work
- Include the NOTICE file if one exists

### What about older versions under AGPL v3?

cdviz-collector versions v0.14 and earlier remain under AGPL v3. If you're using these older versions, the AGPL v3 license terms still apply. We recommend upgrading to v0.15+ to benefit from the Apache License v2.

### When should I consider a commercial subscription?

Consider a commercial subscription if you:

- **Need enterprise features**: Additional functionality not available in the open source version
- **Want professional support**: Direct access to our engineering team
- **Require service level agreements**: Guaranteed response times and support commitments
- **Need consultation services**: Help with implementation, optimization, and best practices
- **Want to support open source development**: Help fund the ongoing maintenance and enhancement of CDviz

Note: This is a service subscription, not a licensing requirement. You can use all open source components freely under Apache License v2, and your subscription helps ensure the continued development and maintenance of the entire project.
